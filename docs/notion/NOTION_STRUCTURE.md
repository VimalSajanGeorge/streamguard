## Linked Databases

### How to Link Issues and Tasks

1. In Tasks database, add a "Related Issue" property (type: Relation)
2. Select "Issues Tracker" as the related database
3. Create two-way relation so issues can show related tasks

This allows you to:
- See which tasks are fixing which issues
- Track issue resolution progress through tasks
- Link documentation to both issues and tasks

---

## Regular Maintenance

### Daily Updates
- Update task statuses as work progresses
- Add new issues as they're discovered
- Update "Last Updated" dates

### Weekly Reviews
- Review "Active Issues" board
- Check task dependencies and blockers
- Update progress percentages
- Archive completed items (move to "Archived" view)

### Monthly Reviews
- Generate progress reports from databases
- Review and update documentation links
- Clean up outdated tasks
- Update phase completion status

---

## Advanced Features

### Formulas (Optional)

Add these to databases for automation:

**Issues Database - Days to Resolution:**
```
dateBetween(prop("Date Resolved"), prop("Date Reported"), "days")
```

**Tasks Database - Is Overdue:**
```
if(and(prop("Status") != "Completed", prop("Due Date") < now()), "⚠️ Overdue", "")
```

### Automations (if using Notion Plus)

1. **Auto-archive completed tasks** after 30 days
2. **Send reminders** for overdue tasks
3. **Update status** when all related tasks complete

---

## Tips for Effective Use

### Best Practices

1. **Update in Real-Time:** Change task/issue status as soon as you start/complete work
2. **Use Templates:** Create page templates for recurring documentation
3. **Link Everything:** Use @ mentions to link related pages, tasks, and issues
4. **Tag Properly:** Use consistent tagging in Categories and Phases
5. **Review Regularly:** Set aside time weekly to review and update

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `/table` - Create new table database
- `/board` - Create board view
- `@` - Mention/link to other pages
- `//` - Add comment
- `Ctrl+/` - Show all shortcuts

## Troubleshooting

### CSV Import Issues

**Problem:** CSV file won't import
**Solution:** Ensure UTF-8 encoding, remove special characters

**Problem:** Dates not importing correctly
**Solution:** Use format YYYY-MM-DD in CSV

**Problem:** Select/Multi-select options not showing
**Solution:** Manually add options after import, then refresh

### Database Relations

**Problem:** Can't create two-way relation
**Solution:** Ensure both databases exist first, then create relation property

**Problem:** Related items not showing
**Solution:** Check filter settings, ensure items aren't hidden by view filters

---

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. ✅ Import both CSV databases
2. ✅ Create main pages with content from NOTION_CONTENT.md
3. ✅ Configure database views as specified
4. ✅ Set up database relations (Issues ↔ Tasks)
5. ✅ Customize colors and icons
6. ✅ Invite team members (if applicable)
7. ✅ Start using for daily tracking!
