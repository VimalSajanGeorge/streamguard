Unicode Encoding Errors - Windows cp1252 Compatibility,Resolved,Critical,2025-10-17,2025-10-17,Unicode Encoding,"Windows console (cp1252) cannot handle Unicode emoji characters (✓, ✗, ⚠, ⚡). These characters are commonly used in console output for status indicators.","Replaced all Unicode emoji characters with ASCII bracket notation: [+] for ✓, [X] for ✗, [!] for ⚠, [*] for ⚡. This ensures compatibility across all Windows console environments.","run_full_collection.py (lines 203, 267, 289, 349); report_generator.py (lines 86, 96); master_orchestrator.py",DATASET_COLLECTION_FIX_AND_ENHANCEMENT.md
Synthetic Data Not Saving to Disk,Resolved,High,2025-10-17,2025-10-17,Data Collection,"The generate_samples() method in SyntheticGenerator class was only returning data without saving it to disk. The method was missing the save_samples() call that exists in other collectors.","Added explicit save_samples() call within generate_samples() method. Now when orchestrator calls generate_samples(), the data is both returned AND saved to synthetic_data.jsonl file.",synthetic_generator.py (line ~349 - generate_samples method),DATA_COLLECTION_VERIFICATION.md
Master Orchestrator KeyError - Variable Name Bug,Resolved,Critical,2025-10-17,2025-10-17,Orchestrator,"In _monitor_progress() method at line 489, code attempted to use variable 'name' which doesn't exist in that scope. The correct variable name is 'collector_name'. This caused KeyError when orchestrator tried to remove completed collectors from active set.","Changed line 489 from 'active_collectors.remove(name)' to 'active_collectors.remove(collector_name)'. Verified variable name matches the iteration variable in the loop.",master_orchestrator.py (line 489),PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md
GitHub Personal Access Token Expired,Resolved,High,2025-10-16,2025-10-16,API,"GitHub API returned 401 Unauthorized error. The Personal Access Token (PAT) stored in .env file had expired. GitHub tokens have limited lifetime and need periodic renewal.","Generated new GitHub Personal Access Token with required scopes (public_repo, read:org, security_events). Updated .env file with new token. Created test_github_token.py script for future token validation.",".env file; github_advisory_collector_enhanced.py (debug logging added)",GITHUB_TOKEN_ISSUE.md
Invalid .env File Entry,Resolved,Low,2025-10-16,2025-10-16,Configuration,"The .env file contained an invalid line 'qqq' on line 26, which could cause environment variable parsing issues.","Removed the invalid 'qqq' entry from .env file. Verified all environment variables are properly formatted as KEY=value pairs.",.env file,DATASET_COLLECTION_FIX_AND_ENHANCEMENT.md
ExploitDB 404 Errors for Old Exploits,Open,Low,2025-10-17,,Data Collection,"Some exploit code files from ExploitDB database (especially older exploits from early 2000s) return 404 Not Found when fetching from GitLab repository. The CSV database has references but files may have been moved or removed.","This is expected behavior. Collector handles these gracefully with error logging. No code fix needed - it's a data availability issue. Consider: (1) Skip exploits older than 2010, (2) Implement fallback to archive.org, or (3) Accept lower success rate for historical data.",exploitdb_collector.py (error handling already implemented),N/A
OSV API Empty Results for Some Ecosystems,Open,Medium,2025-10-17,,Data Collection,"OSV collector returns 0 samples for some ecosystems (PyPI, npm, Maven, Go, crates.io) during test runs. API calls succeed (200 OK) but response contains no vulnerabilities matching query criteria.","Under investigation. Possible causes: (1) Query filters too restrictive, (2) Need to adjust modified_since date range, (3) Pagination not working correctly. Test with broader date ranges and verify query parameters match OSV API documentation.",osv_collector.py (query method),N/A
