# StreamGuard Colab Notebook v1.6 - Complete Documentation

**Version:** 1.6
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Purpose:** Document all changes in v1.6 (Issue #11 Training Collapse Fix + Git-Based Workflow)

---

## Overview

Version 1.6 addresses the **critical training collapse issue (Issue #11)** where the model's F1 score dropped from 0.4337 (epoch 1) to 0.0000 (epochs 3+), and implements a **git-based workflow** to eliminate manual Drive uploads.

---

## Critical Changes

### 1. Training Collapse Fixes (Issue #11)

All 8 fixes have been implemented in `training/train_transformer.py`:

#### Fix 1: Class-Balanced Loss
```python
# Calculate inverse frequency weights
class_counts = torch.bincount(torch.tensor(train_labels))
weight_safe = total / (2.0 * num_safe)              # ~0.923
weight_vulnerable = total / (2.0 * num_vulnerable)  # ~1.091

class_weights = torch.tensor(
    [weight_safe, weight_vulnerable],
    dtype=torch.float32
).to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(
    weight=class_weights,
    label_smoothing=0.05,
    reduction='mean'
)
```

**Why:** Dataset is imbalanced (54.2% safe, 45.8% vulnerable). Without balancing, model learns to predict only the majority class.

#### Fix 2: LR Scaling for Large Batches
```python
base_lr = 2e-5
base_batch = 16

if args.batch_size > base_batch:
    scale_factor = math.sqrt(args.batch_size / base_batch)
    scaled_lr = base_lr * scale_factor
```

**Why:** Original LR (2e-5) was designed for batch=16. Using batch=64 with same LR caused poor convergence.

#### Fix 3: Per-Step Scheduler
```python
# BEFORE (v1.5): Scheduler stepped after each epoch
for epoch in range(epochs):
    train_epoch(...)
    scheduler.step()  # ❌ Wrong!

# AFTER (v1.6): Scheduler steps after each optimizer step
def train_epoch(..., scheduler):
    for step, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        ...
        if (step + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
            optimizer.step()
            scheduler.step()  # ✅ Correct!
```

**Why:** `get_linear_schedule_with_warmup` is a per-step scheduler. Stepping per-epoch caused incorrect learning rate schedule.

#### Fix 4: Gradient Clipping
```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

**Why:** Prevents exploding gradients, especially during early training with warmup.

#### Fix 5: Prediction Distribution Monitoring
```python
pred_distribution = {
    'predicted_vulnerable': int((all_preds == 1).sum()),
    'predicted_safe': int((all_preds == 0).sum()),
    'actual_vulnerable': int((all_labels == 1).sum()),
    'actual_safe': int((all_labels == 0).sum())
}
```

**Why:** Allows early detection of model collapse by tracking if model predicts only one class.

#### Fix 6: Enhanced Collapse Detection
```python
# Check for absolute collapse
if dist['predicted_vulnerable'] == 0 or dist['predicted_safe'] == 0:
    print(f"\n[!] STOPPING: Complete collapse detected")
    break

# Check for severe under-prediction
if pred_vuln < 0.2 * actual_vuln:
    print(f"\n[!] WARNING: Severe under-prediction")
```

**Why:** Stops training early if collapse is detected, saving GPU time.

#### Fix 7: Conservative Label Smoothing
```python
# BEFORE (v1.5): label_smoothing=0.1 (aggressive)
# AFTER (v1.6): label_smoothing=0.05 (conservative)
```

**Why:** Too much smoothing (0.1) can slow or bias training. 0.05 is safer default.

#### Fix 8: Simplified Loss Calculation
```python
# BEFORE (v1.5): Complex sample-level weighting with reduction='none'
# AFTER (v1.6): Simple class-balanced loss with reduction='mean'
```

**Why:** Sample-level weighting added unnecessary complexity. Class weights alone are sufficient.

### 2. Git-Based Workflow

#### Old Workflow (v1.5 and earlier)
1. Mount Google Drive
2. Copy data from Drive to local `/content/data/`
3. Manually upload code changes to Drive
4. Copy code from Drive to Colab
5. Run training

**Problems:**
- Manual uploads after every code change
- Data scattered between Drive and local
- Difficult to track which version is running
- Risk of using stale code

#### New Workflow (v1.6)
1. Clone repository from GitHub
2. Verify data exists in cloned repo
3. Run training directly from cloned repo
4. Push changes to GitHub when needed

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Always using latest code from GitHub
- ✅ No manual uploads
- ✅ Version control built-in
- ✅ Single source of truth (GitHub)
- ✅ Data included in repository (no Drive needed)

#### Cell Changes

**Cell 6 (formerly Cell 9):** Changed from Drive copy to GitHub verification
```python
# OLD (v1.5): Copy from Drive
local_data = Path('/content/data/processed/codexglue')
drive_data = Path('/content/drive/MyDrive/streamguard/data/processed/codexglue')
shutil.copy2(drive_data / file, local_data / file)

# NEW (v1.6): Verify from GitHub clone
repo_data = Path('data/processed/codexglue')
if repo_data.exists():
    size_mb = file_path.stat().st_size / (1024 * 1024)
    print(f"✓ {file} ({size_mb:.2f} MB)")
```

**Benefits:**
- Shows file sizes automatically
- Validates data integrity
- Displays sample counts from metadata
- No Drive dependency

---

### 3. Pre-Training Validation Tests

Added two test cells to verify Issue #11 fixes before full training:

#### Test Cell 6.5: Tiny Overfitting Test
```python
!python training/train_transformer.py \
  --train-data data/processed/codexglue/train.jsonl \
  --val-data data/processed/codexglue/valid.jsonl \
  --quick-test \
  --epochs 10 \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --seed 42
```

**Purpose:** Verify model can learn on 64 samples
**Expected Results:**
- Loss decreases to < 0.5
- F1 score reaches > 0.7
- Balanced predictions (no collapse)
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

#### Test Cell 6.6: Short Full-Data Test
```python
!python training/train_transformer.py \
  --train-data data/processed/codexglue/train.jsonl \
  --val-data data/processed/codexglue/valid.jsonl \
  --test-data data/processed/codexglue/test.jsonl \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch-size 16 \
  --seed 42
```

**Purpose:** Verify training stability with full dataset
**Expected Results:**
- F1 increases each epoch
- Prediction distribution balanced
- No collapse warnings
- Class weights and LR scaling visible in logs
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes (GPU-dependent)

**Why These Tests Matter:**
- Catch issues before wasting hours on full training
- Verify all 8 fixes are working correctly
- Provide confidence before committing to full run
- Save GPU time if something is wrong

## Expected Training Results (v1.6)

### With Issue #11 Fixes

**Epoch 1:**
- Loss: ~0.65
- F1: 0.55-0.65
- Prediction distribution: Balanced (~45-55% each class)

**Epoch 5:**
- Loss: ~0.50
- F1: 0.70-0.75
- Prediction distribution: Balanced (~40-60% each class)

**Epoch 10:**
- Loss: ~0.45
- F1: 0.75-0.80
- Prediction distribution: Balanced (~40-60% each class)

**Final (After all epochs):**
- F1: 0.80-0.85 (realistic target)
- No collapse (model predicts both classes)
- Stable training (no sudden drops)

### What to Look For in Logs

✅ **Good Signs:**
```
[*] Class distribution: Safe=11836, Vulnerable=10018
[*] Class weights: Safe=0.9233, Vulnerable=1.0906
[*] Scaling LR: 2.00e-05 -> 2.83e-05 (batch 64 vs base 16)
[*] Scheduler config: total_steps=683, warmup_steps=68 (10.0%)

Epoch 1/10:
Train Loss: 0.6521
Val Loss: 0.6245
Val F1 (vulnerable): 0.5832
Predictions: Vulnerable=1250/1231, Safe=1482/1501
```

❌ **Bad Signs (v1.5 behavior):**
```
Epoch 3/10:
Val F1 (vulnerable): 0.0000
Predictions: Vulnerable=0/1231, Safe=2732/1501
[!] CRITICAL: Model collapse detected! Only predicting one class.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Data Not Found

**Error:**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/processed/codexglue/train.jsonl'
```

**Solution:**
1. Check you're in the `streamguard` directory: `!pwd`
2. Verify data exists: `!ls -la data/processed/codexglue/`
3. If missing, data wasn't pushed to GitHub. Add and push:
   ```bash
   git add data/processed/codexglue/*.jsonl
   git commit -m "Add preprocessed data"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Problem 2: Test 1 Fails (Cannot Overfit)

**Symptoms:**
- Loss doesn't decrease below 0.6
- F1 stays below 0.6 after 10 epochs

**Possible Causes:**
1. Label smoothing too high (should be 0.05)
2. Regularization too strong (dropout 0.1 is fine)
3. LR too low (check if scaling is applied)

**Solution:** Check training script logs for class weights and LR scaling messages.

### Problem 3: Test 2 Shows Collapse

**Symptoms:**
- F1 drops after epoch 1
- Prediction distribution becomes imbalanced

**Possible Causes:**
1. Class weights not applied (check logs)
2. Scheduler not stepping correctly
3. Gradient explosion (check for NaN losses)

**Solution:** Review ISSUE_11_TRAINING_COLLAPSE_COMPLETE_FIX.md for detailed debugging.

## Performance Considerations

### Git Clone Performance

**Question:** Won't cloning a 657 MB repository slow down startup?

**Answer:** No, because:
1. GitHub uses compression (actual transfer ~200-300 MB)
2. Colab has fast internet (100+ Mbps)
3. Clone happens once per session (~30-60 seconds)
4. Much faster than mounting Drive + copying files

### Data in Repository

**Question:** Is it good practice to store data in Git?

**Answer:** For this case, yes:
- Data is preprocessed and static
- Only 657 MB (well within GitHub limits)
- Ensures reproducibility
- Easier for users (no separate download)

**Better Alternative for Production:**
- Use Git LFS for large files
- Or store data in S3/GCS and download via script
- But for a research project, in-repo is fine

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After v1.6 Release)
1. ✅ Run test cells (6.5 and 6.6) to verify fixes
2. ⏳ Run 2-3 epoch validation on full data
3. ⏳ Monitor for collapse and check prediction distribution
4. ⏳ If tests pass, proceed to full training

### Short-Term
1. Run full training (10 epochs on T4, 15 on V100, 20 on A100)
2. Monitor F1 progression (should improve each epoch)
3. Check for collapse warnings (should be none)
4. Validate final F1 is 0.75-0.85

### Long-Term
1. Hyperparameter sweep (see ISSUE_11_FINAL_CAUTIONS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
2. Experiment with different warmup ratios (0.05-0.15)
3. Try different class weight strategies
4. Consider Phase 2 training with collector data
